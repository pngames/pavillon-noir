Building/Installing Pavillon Noir
---------------------------------

Step 1 :
=======

This project needs a c++ compiler and its development files (STL includes, etc.)
The following libraries are also needed :
 - SDL >= 1.2.7
 - Boost (filesystem and threads) >= 1.33
 - LibXml2 >= 2.6.16
 - FOX >= 1.4.10
 - DevIL
 - GLEW
 - CEGUI >= 0.4.0
 - Lua 5.0
 - ToLua++
 - OPAL (provided for both linux and windows x86 platforms)
 - OpenAL
 - Ogg >= 1.1.2
 - VorbisFile >= 1.1.0

Optionally, you could have the Scons building system installed onto your system. 
If not we provide a mini-scons archive that'll do the work.

Step 2 :
=======

Build the project. To achieve this, just type 'scons' and it'll do the work. By
default, Pavillon Noir will be installed in /usr/local/games. It will also be 
built with no debug symbols. If you want to install in another place, just give
the prefix to scons as this :
	scons prefix=/another/place

It will so install to /another/place/pavillon-noir.
To enable a build with debug symbols just give the 'debug=full' to scons as this :
	scons debug=full

You can indeed enable a debug build with a prefix of your choice.

If you don't have Scons installed on your system, don't worry. Just use the 
./configure script provided with the same flags explained above and run 'make'.
It will do the job as scons would.

Step 3 :
=======

Now that Pavillon Noir is fully builded, just run 'scons install' (with root
permissions if you don't install in your home directory) and it will be fine.
If you used the configure script, a make install will do the same thing.

Now you just have to fire up pavillon-noir from its location and enjoy !
