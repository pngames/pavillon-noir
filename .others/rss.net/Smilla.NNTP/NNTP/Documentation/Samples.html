		<h1>Smilla .NET Communication Library Samples</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>There are two sample applications that ship with Smilla .NET Communication 
			Library. One is written using Windows Forms (Smilla News Reader) and another 
			using ASP.NET.</p>
		<h2>Windows Forms Sample Application - Smilla News Reader</h2>
		<p>Smilla News Reader is a sample application that is supposed to demonstrate ways 
			of using Smilla .NET Communication Library. It shows usage of the library's 
			main features as well as some common techniques that you can use in your 
			application. These are some suggestions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			This sample application is not intended to be a production-ready software. For 
			example you'll probably don't want to get a whole list of newsgroups each time 
			you work with some server. Instead you may hold this list locally and get only 
			new newsgroups each time you connect.
			<li>
			Smilla News Reader uses ThreadPool object for time-consuming operations such as 
			getting articles list. Please refer to .NET Framework documentation for 
			detailed information on threading.
			<li>
				We use WebBrowser ActiveX control (actually Internet Explorer) for displaying 
				articles. It makes possible to display both plain-text and HTML messages. 
				Please pay attention to the method of displaying embedded images in HTML.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>ASP.NET Sample Application - Smilla Web Reader</h2>
		<p>
			Smilla Web Reader is a simple web application that can connect to the specified 
			news server, get list of articles and read them. Smilla Web Reader is also not 
			an example of a perfect news reader. In web environment you would probably 
			rather cache newsgroups information periodically somewhere in a database than 
			receive it every time from a remote news server. But Smilla Web Reader gives an 
			idea of using Smilla .NET Communication Library&nbsp;with ASP.NET.</p>
